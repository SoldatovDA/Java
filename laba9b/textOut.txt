From Fairest Creatures We Desire Increase,
That Thereby Beauty's Rose Might Never Die,
But As The Riper Should By Time Decease,
His Tender Heir Might Bear His Memory:
But Thou, Contracted To Thine Own Bright Eyes,
Feed'st Thy Light'st Flame With Self-substantial Fuel,
Making A Famine Where Abundance Lies,
Thyself Thy Foe, To Thy Sweet Self Too Cruel.
